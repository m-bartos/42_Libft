# 42_Libft
The first project of Common Core at 42 Prague. The goal is to create my very first library. Recoded several functions from **libc** and more (linked lists included). The Libft is used in the majority of my subsequent projects because the standard C library (**libc**) is forbidden to be used for 42 projects.

## Most useful functions
* ft_atoi
* ft_calloc
* ft_itoa
* ft_lst*** (all linked-list functions)
* ft_split
* ft_strchr (+ ft_strrchr)
* ft_strdup
* ft_strjoin
* ft_strlen
* ft_strncmp
* ft_strtrim
* ft_substr

## What I learned
* I learned about Makefiles and header files (what, why and how to use them)
* Compile library with Makefile
* I learned the basics of structs
* I learned about linked lists
* I learned the basics of file descriptors
